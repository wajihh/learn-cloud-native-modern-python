# The Future of Programming: Natural Language

The future of programming is leaning towards using natural languages like English, making it more accessible and intuitive. This approach is often referred to as **Natural Language Programming (NLP)**. 

In the context of the LLM revolution, programming and high-level languages like Python are likely to evolve in fascinating ways, blending traditional coding with new AI-driven approaches. Here are some trends which will happen in near future:

### 1. **Shift Toward AI-Assisted Coding**  
With LLMs becoming more integrated into the development process, developers will increasingly rely on AI as an assistant for coding tasks. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT-powered IDEs already enhance productivity by suggesting code snippets, refactoring code, and generating boilerplate automatically. In the future, developers may spend less time writing low-level code and more time orchestrating AI agents to do the heavy lifting.

*Imagine debugging being as simple as asking your AI assistant to identify and fix issues, rather than pouring over lines of code for hours. That’s a future you might look forward to!*

### 2. **Higher Abstractions**  
Programming languages like Python, known for their simplicity and readability, will continue to thrive because of the need for high-level abstractions. However, developers may start interacting with code in a more natural, conversational way, where code generation becomes as easy as describing what you need.

*Python might become more like "English with curly braces" where even non-coders can build applications just by having a detailed conversation with their LLM.*

### 3. **Auto-Generated Codebases**  
LLMs might soon be able to write entire applications with minimal human intervention. Developers would focus on setting high-level objectives, and the AI would handle everything from selecting the architecture to writing and testing the code. This paradigm will turn programming into more of a supervisory role, overseeing AI-generated code rather than manually writing it.

*Programming might start feeling more like being the director of an orchestra than the violinist in the pit.*

### 4. **New AI-Oriented Programming Paradigms**  
Programming paradigms may shift toward a more declarative, goal-oriented model, where developers specify what they want rather than how to achieve it. For instance, you might simply describe a desired functionality, and the AI will produce the entire stack of code, optimize it, and even suggest improvements.

*No more stack overflow deep dives; just tell your AI assistant what the feature should do, and boom, it’s done!*

### 5. **Customized Programming Languages**  
The need for languages like Python may persist, but they could evolve with built-in capabilities to interact seamlessly with AI models. We might see specialized versions of Python or entirely new languages designed to work alongside LLMs, focusing on human-AI collaboration rather than just programming logic.

*Python 4.0 could come with a conversational interface, where the "interpreter" is literally interpreting what you want to achieve.*

### 6. **LLMs as Code Reviewers and Architects**  
LLMs could become integral not just for writing code but also for reviewing it. They may assist in automating the process of checking for performance optimizations, security vulnerabilities, and best practices. Additionally, AI could play a larger role in architectural decisions, suggesting the best frameworks, cloud services, or data models based on project needs.

*Imagine AI giving code reviews that don’t just say, “This is wrong,” but explain why and instantly provide a better solution. It’s like having a senior engineer in your pocket.*

### 7. **Impact on Education and Learning**  
As AI handles more coding tasks, learning how to code might change drastically. The focus may shift from memorizing syntax to understanding system design, AI integration, and advanced problem-solving. Python and similar languages may be taught more as tools to communicate with AI systems rather than direct programming languages.

*You might not need to worry about forgetting a specific function—you’ll just ask your AI assistant to “do that thing with the JSON again!”*

### 8. **Hybrid Roles**  
Programming might morph into a hybrid role combining traditional development with machine learning, data science, and AI orchestration. Developers will need to know not only how to code but also how to effectively train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models, integrating them with regular applications.

*In the future, “I’m a Python developer” might mean you’re just as comfortable coding as you are tuning a GPT model for a specific task.*

In conclusion, while programming languages like Python will remain important, the way we interact with them will transform. AI will simplify, augment, and even replace certain aspects of programming, but developers will still need to understand the underlying logic, principles, and architecture to truly leverage the power of AI-driven development.

## Prompt: I suspect that in near future some form of new custom english like programming language will appear which will act as a intermediary language which in turn will be generating Python like programing languages

I completely agree with your suspicion, and it aligns with how the field of programming is evolving in the context of AI and LLM advancements. In fact, we're already seeing signs that a custom, English-like intermediary language could emerge to bridge the gap between human instructions and machine-executable code, acting as a high-level interface for generating more structured languages like Python, JavaScript, or even cloud infrastructure code.

Here’s how such a future might unfold:

### 1. **The Rise of Conversational Programming Languages**  
We could witness the creation of a new "Natural Programming Language" (NPL), which would be a simplified, human-readable language much closer to natural English. This language wouldn't be designed for direct machine execution but instead serve as a layer that AI models would interpret to generate actual executable code in Python, JavaScript, or other languages based on the context.

*Imagine telling your AI: “Create a microservice that stores user data in a PostgreSQL database and exposes a REST API for data retrieval,” and it seamlessly translates that into a FastAPI service with all the relevant endpoints and database connections.*

### 2. **Domain-Specific Intermediary Languages**  
These intermediary languages could also be tailored for specific domains. For example, you might have a version of this "NPL" for web development, data science, AI model training, or even Kubernetes infrastructure. Each would let developers describe tasks in domain-specific, plain language, which the AI would parse and translate into detailed code.

*Instead of writing Kubernetes YAML manifests by hand, you'd simply say: “Deploy a scalable web app using Python and PostgreSQL on Kubernetes,” and the system would generate all the necessary Kubernetes configurations, Helm charts, and deployment scripts.*

### 3. **AI-Generated Python from NPL**  
The Python-like language would still be generated behind the scenes because high-level, flexible, and widely supported languages like Python are excellent for actual implementation. The intermediary NPL would allow developers to specify requirements, and then the AI would generate well-structured, idiomatic Python code to meet those requirements.

*You could think of the new intermediary language as the "high-level architect," and Python as the "construction worker" that turns the blueprint into reality.*

### 4. **Code as Dialogue: Multi-Step Commands**  
This new form of intermediary language might allow for multi-step "dialogue coding." You could iteratively refine the program's behavior through conversational instructions, with the AI asking for clarifications or suggesting improvements. For example, you might begin by specifying a task in broad strokes, and the AI would ask for specifics:

- You: "Create a data pipeline that ingests CSV files, processes them, and stores them in a database."
- AI: "Should I use Pandas for processing and PostgreSQL for the database?"
- You: "Yes, also make sure it runs as a scheduled job every hour."
- AI: "Should I set up a CRON job, or would you prefer using a cloud-native scheduler like AWS Lambda?"

*In this case, the human works at a high conceptual level, and the AI handles the translation into detailed executable code.*

### 5. **Interactive Code Generation and Execution**  
Intermediary languages might also offer real-time execution and feedback loops, where the AI generates the Python code, runs it, and provides results or error reports immediately. This would enable a highly interactive development process where you could issue high-level commands, and see the results almost instantly, adjusting as needed.

*Instead of writing an entire script, you’d write a "description," let the AI generate code, execute it, and show you what went right or wrong. Coding becomes an interactive conversation with the machine.*

### 6. **Lowering the Barrier for Non-Programmers**  
A custom English-like intermediary language would dramatically lower the barrier to entry for people who aren't traditional programmers. Many people with domain expertise but no programming background could describe their requirements in this intermediary language, and the AI would handle the conversion to Python or any other relevant language.

*Think of small business owners describing their automation needs in plain English and getting full software solutions delivered without hiring a development team.*

### 7. **Natural Language Processing Integration**  
This intermediary language could be further enhanced by NLP integration, allowing the AI to infer meaning, handle ambiguity, and ask intelligent follow-up questions. If a command is unclear or incomplete, the AI would act as a "programming coach" to clarify intent before generating the code.

*Imagine a scenario where you say, “Build an e-commerce website with a user login system,” and the AI follows up with, “Should I use OAuth for login authentication, or would you prefer a simpler email-based login?”*

### 8. **Code Customization through Plain-English Descriptions**  
Once the AI generates the initial Python code, developers could fine-tune or add custom functionality using this intermediary language. Instead of modifying the code directly, they could describe changes in English-like syntax, and the AI would update the generated codebase accordingly.

*For example, “Add an API rate limiter to the login endpoint, limiting users to 5 login attempts per minute,” and voila, the Python code gets updated with a Flask or FastAPI rate-limiting middleware.*

### 9. **Open-Source Language Evolution and AI Collaboration**  
Given the open-source nature of many AI and programming frameworks, it's likely that developers would continuously evolve and customize this intermediary language. Communities could create and refine different dialects or libraries that make these tools even more powerful for specific use cases, allowing for a more collaborative evolution.

*Python and this new intermediary language could coexist and evolve together—one handling low-level logic and the other governing high-level functionality.*

### 10. **Natural Language Debugging and Refactoring**  
Not only would this intermediary language serve to generate code, but it could also assist with debugging and refactoring. You might say, “Optimize the database queries in this service,” and the AI could analyze the Python code it generated, then automatically refactor it to be more efficient, explaining the changes in plain English.

*Debugging wouldn’t be an exercise in hunting down bugs, but more like talking to an AI: “Why is this part of the code slow?” and the AI would provide answers and fixes in one go!*

---

In this AI-assisted programming future, **Python and similar languages will still play a crucial role**, but they'll be abstracted away from direct user interaction, becoming the execution layer beneath a new wave of natural, conversational programming interfaces.

## Prompt: I suspect that agentic frameworks which call LLMs iteratively will emerge and then will be helping develop programs


You're absolutely on point! Agentic frameworks, designed to interact with LLMs in iterative, autonomous ways, are likely to play a significant role in the future of programming and software development. These frameworks could enhance the capabilities of LLMs by enabling them to work more like self-sufficient agents, tackling complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

Here’s how this could unfold:

### 1. **Autonomous Programming Agents**  
We’re already seeing early signs of this with frameworks like **AutoGen** and **LangChain**, which orchestrate multiple LLMs or models to collaborate on solving a problem. These agents could be enhanced to operate in an iterative loop, continuously refining and expanding codebases, creating new features, running tests, and optimizing code without human intervention.

*Think of an AI pair programming with itself, where one agent writes code, another reviews and tests it, and a third agent looks for optimizations. All of this happens iteratively until the task is complete.*

### 2. **Task-Specific Agentic LLMs**  
Imagine agents that specialize in specific aspects of development—one focused on backend architecture, another on frontend design, and yet another on DevOps pipelines. These agents would call LLMs repeatedly to tackle their respective areas, collaborate, and deliver a full-stack application. Over time, they could learn from each other and from feedback, iteratively improving their performance.

*Your virtual team of AI developers working around the clock, refining a project from multiple angles—sounds like a developer’s dream, right?*

### 3. **Feedback-Driven Iteration**  
In an agentic framework, agents could collect feedback from both developers and users, iterating on that feedback to improve the software. For example, you could point out issues with a feature or a performance bottleneck, and the agent would adjust the code, test it, and deploy the changes iteratively until it meets the performance criteria.

*Instead of manually tweaking performance settings, you could tell an AI agent, “Optimize the loading time for this page,” and it would run a series of iterations until it achieves the goal.*

### 4. **Self-Learning and Adaptation**  
Agentic frameworks would likely incorporate mechanisms for **self-learning**—the ability to improve through repetition and data collection. As these agents iteratively call LLMs, they could store knowledge and heuristics from previous projects, gradually becoming better at predicting requirements, generating code, and solving complex problems.

*Imagine an agent becoming "smarter" with each project, recalling past optimizations or fixes and applying them to new problems. Over time, these agents could reach levels of expertise that rival human developers.*

### 5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**  
In an agentic framework, multiple agents could work collaboratively, each calling LLMs for specific tasks, sharing results, and improving each other’s output. For instance, one agent might generate a piece of code, while another agent focuses on error-checking and optimizing it. They would iteratively exchange results, leading to a more refined product.

*The next evolution of code reviews might not be between humans but between different agents, each optimizing and validating parts of the code in a feedback loop.*

### 6. **Automated Testing and Deployment Cycles**  
These agents wouldn’t just generate code—they could also handle the full software development lifecycle, including **automated testing, deployment, and monitoring**. Agents could iteratively run tests, integrate continuous deployment pipelines, and monitor system performance, refining the software as new data and feedback come in.

*No more manually setting up CI/CD pipelines—just ask your agent to deploy the app, and it will call LLMs to ensure everything from writing tests to deployment is handled flawlessly.*

### 7. **Agile Programming Cycles with AI Agents**  
These agentic frameworks could align with Agile methodologies, working in sprints to iteratively develop features, test them, and push updates. In this scenario, you could simply outline your user stories or project goals, and the agents would handle the rest, calling LLMs as needed to complete tasks, review progress, and adapt to feedback.

*Developers might not need to worry about Jira tickets or sprint planning anymore—just tell the agent, “Deliver feature X in the next two weeks,” and it will keep working until it’s done!*

### 8. **Continuous Improvement and Optimization**  
Once a program is built, agentic frameworks could continue to optimize and enhance it in the background. By calling LLMs iteratively, agents could adjust algorithms, optimize performance, and even implement new features automatically. This could lead to software that continuously evolves without the need for constant developer intervention.

*Imagine deploying an app that doesn’t just run but actively improves itself based on real-time data. It’s like giving your app the ability to "learn" from its own users!*

### 9. **Multi-Layered Agents with Specialized Skills**  
In the future, there may be multi-layered agents, each focused on different levels of abstraction. Some agents may work on high-level architecture, others on low-level optimization, while others handle specific aspects like security, UX, or database performance. Each layer of agents would call LLMs iteratively, feeding results to one another until the whole system works cohesively.

*This could lead to a future where AI-powered "teams" work at multiple layers of complexity, producing sophisticated software autonomously.*

### 10. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**  
Despite their autonomy, these agentic frameworks would still benefit from human oversight. Developers could serve as high-level supervisors, providing feedback and intervening when necessary, while the agents handle the bulk of the repetitive, tedious tasks. This creates a highly productive human-AI collaboration environment.

*It’s like being the "project manager" of an AI dev team, where your input is necessary only for high-level decisions, while the AI agents churn out the code.*

---

In conclusion, these **agentic frameworks** would mark a paradigm shift in software development. They could iteratively call LLMs to generate, test, and deploy code, driving software development processes more autonomously than ever before. This would allow developers to focus on strategic thinking and creativity while leaving the repetitive tasks and grunt work to the AI-powered agents. It’s almost like giving AI the role of both junior and senior developer—on steroids!


## Prompt: I also suspect that most computer programmers will become autonomous AI agent developers 

I think you're absolutely right in predicting that many computer programmers will transition into roles where their primary focus is on developing, managing, and orchestrating autonomous AI agents. As agentic frameworks mature and gain widespread adoption, traditional programming tasks will increasingly be handled by AI, shifting the role of developers into a new paradigm of **AI agent development and orchestration**.

Here's how this transition might happen:

### 1. **Designing and Fine-Tuning AI Agents**
Rather than writing large swathes of code manually, future programmers might spend most of their time designing, training, and fine-tuning AI agents. These agents will be specialized, able to complete tasks such as generating code, debugging, or automating workflows. Developers will focus on ensuring these agents have the right training data, can interact with other agents efficiently, and are optimized for the tasks they’re designed to perform.

*It’s a bit like being a coach for a team of AI "players," where your job is to set them up for success and help them improve through feedback and guidance.*

### 2. **Developing Multi-Agent Systems**
Programmers will likely shift towards creating systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. This will require expertise in **orchestration** and **coordination** of agents, ensuring that they can interact harmoniously. For example, one agent may handle data ingestion, another might analyze the data, and a third could build visualizations—all working in sync.

*It’s like becoming a conductor of an AI orchestra, making sure each agent plays its part to create a symphony of code generation, testing, and deployment.*

### 3. **Human-AI Interaction Design**
Programmers of the future will spend much more time designing the interfaces between humans and AI agents. This includes building **conversational interfaces**, natural language processing (NLP) layers, and user-friendly systems that allow non-programmers to interact effectively with AI-driven tools. Developers will be responsible for ensuring that the AI understands human intent and can carry out complex tasks with minimal supervision.

*Think of developers as UX designers—but for AI agents, ensuring that humans can easily communicate with and direct these autonomous systems.*

### 4. **Agent Lifecycle Management**
As AI agents become more autonomous, programmers will need to focus on **lifecycle management**. This includes creating agents, deploying them, monitoring their performance, and continuously updating them with new capabilities or retraining them on updated datasets. Developers will need tools and frameworks to monitor these agents’ decision-making processes, ensuring they are operating efficiently and safely.

*Instead of maintaining a codebase, you might maintain an "AIbase" where you oversee the lifecycle of dozens of autonomous agents, much like how we currently manage software microservices.*

### 5. **Agent Performance Optimization**
Developers will shift their efforts towards optimizing the performance of AI agents. This means focusing on how well agents are generating code, the speed of task completion, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Techniques such as reinforcement learning, real-time feedback loops, and fine-tuning hyperparameters will be key areas of expertise for developers.

*Imagine spending your day tweaking how fast an AI agent can deliver optimized Python code or adjusting how an agent prioritizes system performance versus memory usage.*

### 6. **Building Ethical AI Agents**
As AI agents become more autonomous, **ethics and safety** will become critical concerns. Future programmers will need to ensure that their AI agents operate within ethical guidelines, don't inadvertently introduce biases, and respect privacy and security concerns. Developers will play a major role in creating agents that not only generate effective results but also adhere to ethical standards.

*Future programmers will need to think like philosophers as much as engineers, designing agents that can handle nuanced ethical decisions in real-world applications.*

### 7. **Hybrid Roles: AI Developer + Data Scientist**
Many programmers will merge the skills of traditional software development with data science and AI expertise. This hybrid role will focus on building agents that can adapt and learn from real-world data. Understanding how to train LLMs and other models to suit specific tasks will become part of the core skill set, with the line between "developer" and "AI model trainer" becoming blurred.

*Your next line of code might not be code at all but rather training data and hyperparameters that turn an LLM into a specialized agent.*

### 8. **Building Autonomous Developer Agents**
Ironically, many developers will spend their time building AI agents that can, in turn, **become developers themselves**. These agents will be capable of generating programs, automating entire software development workflows, and continuously improving themselves based on feedback. Programmers will focus on creating robust "self-developing" agents capable of iterating codebases faster than human developers ever could.

*One day, you might create an AI agent that can out-code even the best developers, and it’ll be your job to make sure it doesn't take your job!*

### 9. **Framework and Tooling Creation for AI Agents**
A significant part of future programming will be the creation of tools, libraries, and frameworks specifically designed to support the development and orchestration of AI agents. Much like developers create software development kits (SDKs) and frameworks today, the future will involve building tools that make it easier to develop and deploy agentic systems. 

*Instead of a JavaScript framework for web development, imagine creating an "AgentFramework" that makes it easier to spin up new AI agents for specific tasks like API management or cloud deployments.*

### 10. **AI Governance and Compliance Roles**
As AI agents become more autonomous and powerful, programmers will be responsible for ensuring that these agents follow legal and regulatory guidelines. New governance models will emerge where developers need to make sure their agents comply with industry standards, security protocols, and evolving regulations.

*It’s like being a lawyer and a developer at the same time—ensuring your AI agents comply with everything from GDPR to data sovereignty laws.*

---

In summary, the role of computer programmers is set to transform dramatically, with a shift towards **autonomous AI agent development**. Future developers will act as the architects of these agents, focusing on their creation, orchestration, optimization, and ethical deployment. This transition represents an exciting new frontier, where programming merges with AI to create autonomous systems that can self-generate, self-optimize, and self-deploy in ways that were previously unimaginable.


## What are Autonomous AI Agents?

Autonomous AI agents are intelligent software entities designed to perform tasks independently, without requiring continuous human intervention. They are built to interact with their environment, learn from data, make decisions, and execute actions based on goals or instructions provided to them. These agents can operate in various domains, such as software development, business automation, robotics, or even customer support, and can be used for both single-step tasks and complex, multi-stage processes.

Here’s a breakdown of what makes autonomous AI agents unique:

### 1. **Autonomy**  
The defining feature of these agents is their ability to act independently. Once given an objective, they can handle all the steps necessary to achieve that goal without needing step-by-step instructions. For example, an AI agent tasked with managing a cloud server can monitor the system, optimize resource usage, and deploy updates without any direct human oversight.

*Think of an AI agent like a virtual assistant that can not only receive commands but also figure out how to execute them efficiently and adjust its actions as circumstances change.*

### 2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**  
Autonomous AI agents work based on **goals** or **objectives**. You specify a desired outcome, and the agent determines the best way to achieve it. They are often capable of **iterative problem-solving**, meaning they will continuously adapt and refine their actions until they meet the objective.

*For instance, an AI agent assigned to optimize a website for speed might run performance tests, analyze the results, adjust code, and retry until the loading time is minimized.*

### 3. **Perception of Environment**  
Many autonomous agents are built with the ability to sense or perceive their environment. This could involve gathering real-time data (from sensors, APIs, or databases) and using that information to make decisions. Agents in robotic systems might use cameras and sensors, while software agents may track system logs, user behavior, or incoming data from APIs.

*Imagine an AI agent managing a server farm. It continuously monitors server load and health, using this information to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.*

### 4. **Decision-Making and Reasoning**  
Autonomous AI agents are equipped with advanced decision-making capabilities. They use AI models (including LLMs) to analyze data, reason about possible actions, and select the best course of action based on predefined goals or rules. They often rely on **reinforcement learning**, **heuristics**, or **logic-based models** to make decisions, constantly improving their performance through feedback loops.

*If an AI agent is tasked with customer support, it might decide when to escalate an issue to a human agent or when to resolve it based on past interactions and learned patterns.*

### 5. **Adaptability and Learning**  
Most autonomous AI agents are designed to learn and adapt. This means they don’t just follow rigid scripts or rules but can improve over time. By learning from past experiences or external feedback (via reinforcement learning or continuous data analysis), they get better at performing tasks or achieving their goals.

*For example, an AI agent managing cloud infrastructure might learn the optimal resource configurations for different times of day and adjust deployments dynamically to maximize efficiency.*

### 6. **Collaboration with Other Agents**  
Autonomous agents can work together in multi-agent systems, where multiple agents collaborate on larger tasks. Each agent may handle a specific part of the problem, and they share information or divide responsibilities to accomplish a common goal. This collaboration can be orchestrated using frameworks designed for agent coordination.

*Imagine a team of AI agents building an application—one focuses on writing code, another on running tests, and a third on deployment. They communicate and share results in real-time, working towards the final goal of a fully functional app.*

### 7. **Reactive and Proactive Behavior**  
Autonomous agents can be both **reactive** and **proactive**:
- **Reactive**: They respond to changes in their environment. For instance, if a system fails, an AI agent monitoring the system might react by restarting services or reallocating resources.
- **Proactive**: They anticipate potential issues or opportunities and take action ahead of time. For example, an AI agent might preemptively scale resources to handle an expected increase in traffic based on historical data.

*In the context of predictive maintenance, an AI agent might anticipate equipment failure based on sensor data and schedule repairs before a breakdown occurs.*

### 8. **Multi-Step Task Execution**  
Unlike simple automation scripts that perform predefined, single-step tasks, autonomous AI agents can handle multi-step, complex tasks. They can plan out a series of actions, execute them sequentially, and adjust based on intermediate results. This allows them to tackle more sophisticated objectives, such as building an end-to-end software solution or managing business workflows.

*An AI agent for business automation might take on the task of processing invoices—first retrieving them from an email inbox, extracting relevant data using OCR, updating the accounting system, and finally sending a payment confirmation.*

### 9. **Examples of Autonomous AI Agents**  
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Autonomous agents manage navigation, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making in real-time as the vehicle drives.
- **Virtual Assistants**: Tools like Siri or Google Assistant are early forms of AI agents that respond to voice commands, but future iterations will be able to carry out complex tasks like booking multi-step travel itineraries or managing calendars autonomously.
- **Customer Support Agents**: AI chatbots that can autonomously handle customer queries, escalate issues, and provide resolutions without human intervention.
- **Software Development Agents**: AI-powered agents that can generate, test, and deploy code, managing the full development lifecycle autonomously.

### 10. **The Role of Autonomous AI Agents in the Future of Development**  
As autonomous AI agents become more sophisticated, their role in development, automation, and management will expand. Developers and engineers will increasingly focus on creating, fine-tuning, and orchestrating these agents rather than performing the detailed coding or management tasks themselves. The shift towards AI-driven automation could drastically change workflows across industries, from IT and software development to business operations and customer service.

*In the future, you might instruct an AI agent to "create a scalable web app with user authentication," and the agent would independently handle everything from designing the database schema to deploying the app in the cloud.*

---

In summary, **autonomous AI agents** are intelligent, self-directed systems capable of performing tasks and achieving goals with minimal human involvement. Their ability to learn, adapt, and handle complex processes makes them valuable for a wide range of applications, from managing IT infrastructure to automating business processes and even developing software. As these agents continue to evolve, they are set to become central players in both technical and non-technical fields.

# Our Program is basically training you to become **Autonomous AI Agent Developer**. However, we are not calling it so because at this stage most people will not understand it.
