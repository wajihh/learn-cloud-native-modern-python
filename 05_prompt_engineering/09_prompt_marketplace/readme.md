We will be using [PromptBase](https://promptbase.com/), as our default marketplace.

Individuals are earning income by selling prompts on **PromptBase**, though the amounts are generally modest and should be viewed as supplementary income rather than a primary source.

**Earnings Overview:**

- **Average Earnings:** A successful seller with 335 sales at an average price of $2.99 per prompt has earned approximately $801.32 over three months. After PromptBase's 20% fee and considering expenses like a MidJourney subscription, the net monthly income is around $237.10. 

- **Pricing Limitations:** New sellers are limited to a maximum prompt price of $4.99, which can be increased with a proven sales record. Additionally, there's a daily submission limit of two prompts. 

- **Platform Fees:** PromptBase retains 20% of each sale, allowing sellers to keep 80% of their earnings. 

**Considerations:**

- **Realistic Expectations:** While PromptBase offers an opportunity to monetize prompt engineering skills, it's important to maintain realistic expectations. Earnings are typically in the range of a few hundred dollars per month, making it a viable side hustle but not a replacement for full-time income. 

- **Quality and Demand:** Success on PromptBase depends on creating high-quality, in-demand prompts. Understanding market trends and user needs can enhance sales potential. 

**Conclusion:**

Selling prompts on PromptBase can generate supplementary income, with some sellers earning a few hundred dollars monthly. However, it's essential to approach this opportunity with realistic expectations and an understanding of the platform's limitations and fee structures.
