Large language models can produce and interpret outputs in many formats. However, Markdown has become a convenient default for a few reasons:


**1. Readability:** It’s more human-friendly than raw HTML and allows quick rendering of headings, bold/italic text, bullet points, etc.

**2.	Simplicity:** It’s easier to type and parse by both humans and downstream applications (like chat interfaces or APIs that convert Markdown to rich text).

**3.	Widespread Support:** Many platforms support Markdown out of the box, so it has become a kind of “lowest common denominator” for lightweight formatting.

In practice, there’s no hard requirement for Markdown. It’s just a popular, user-friendly default that makes the output nicely formatted wherever it’s displayed.

Markdown can be helpful for both **writing prompts and structuring outputs**. Here’s why Markdown is often useful for prompt writing:

**1.	Clarity and Readability:** Markdown lets you visually separate sections, use headings, bullet points, or bold/italics to emphasize important parts of the prompt. This makes it easier to read, both for you while editing and for the model to parse structure cues.

**2.	Segmenting Complex Prompts:** If you have a multi-part prompt—like a set of instructions followed by example inputs, followed by constraints—Markdown headings and formatting can help keep all those sections organized.

**3.	Consistency:** Using a uniform format (like Markdown) for your prompts means you can maintain consistent styles across different tasks or projects. This consistency may indirectly help models better respond to similar structures in your prompts.

**4.	Ease of Collaboration:** If you’re sharing prompts with others (e.g., via GitHub or other text-based platforms), Markdown’s readability benefits help collaborators quickly grasp the contents and structure, without extra tooling.

Overall, Markdown is a great way to write prompts in a clean, structured manner—just as it is for output.
