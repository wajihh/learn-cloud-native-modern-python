## Problem Statement

Print 10 random numbers in the range 1 to 100.

Here is an example run:

45
79
61
47
52
10
16
83
19
12

Each time you run your program you should get different numbers

81
76
70
1
27
63
96
100
32
92

Recall that the python random library has a function randint which returns an integer in the range set by the parameters (inclusive). For example this call would produce a random integer between 1 and 6, which could include 1 and could include 6:

value = random.randint(1, 6)

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Solution

```bash

import random

N_NUMBERS : int = 10
MIN_VALUE : int = 1
MAX_VALUE : int = 100

def main():
    """
    You should write your code here. Make sure to delete 
    the 'pass' line before starting to write your own code.
    """
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
