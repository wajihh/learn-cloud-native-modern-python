## Problem Statement

Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Solution
```bash
def get_name():
    return "Sophia"

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

def main():
    name = get_name() # get_name() will return a string which we store to the 'name' variable here
    print("Howdy", name, "! ðŸ¤ ")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
