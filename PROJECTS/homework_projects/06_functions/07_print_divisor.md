## Problem Statement

Write the helper function print_divisors(num), which takes in a number and prints all of its divisors (all the numbers from 1 to num inclusive that num can be cleanly divided by (there is no remainder to the division). Don't forget to call your function in main()!

Here's a sample run (user input is in blue):

Enter a number: 12 
Here are the divisors of 12 
1 
2 
3 
4 
6 
12

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Solution

```bash
def print_divisors(num: int):
    print("Here are the divisors of", num)
    for i in range(num):
        curr_divisor = i + 1
        if num % curr_divisor == 0:
            print(curr_divisor)

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print_divisors(num)


# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
