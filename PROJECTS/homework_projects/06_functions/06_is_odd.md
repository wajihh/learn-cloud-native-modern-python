## Problem Statement

10 even
11 odd
12 even
13 odd
14 even
15 odd
16 even
17 odd
18 even
19 odd

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Solution
```bash
def main():
    for i in range(10):
        if is_odd(i):
            print('odd')
        else:
            print('even')
            
def is_odd(value: int):
    """
    Checks to see if a value is odd. If it is, returns true.
    """
    
    remainder = value % 2  # 0 if value is divisible by 2, 1 if it isn't
    return remainder == 1


# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
