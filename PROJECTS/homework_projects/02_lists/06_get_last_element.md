## Problem Statement

Fill out the function get_last_element(lst) which takes in a list lst as a parameter and prints the last element in the list. The list is guaranteed to be non-empty, but there are no guarantees on its length.

## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Solution

def get_last_element(lst):
    """
    Prints the last element of the provided list.
    """

    # Takes the length of the list and minuses 1 since they are zero-indexed (we start counting at 0)
    print(lst[len(lst) - 1])

    # The line below works too!!
    # print(lst[-1]) 

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

def get_lst():
    """
    Prompts the user to enter one element of the list at a time and returns the resulting list.
    """
    lst = []
    elem = input("Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. ")
    while elem != "":
        lst.append(elem)
        elem = input("Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. ")
    return lst

def main():
    lst = get_lst()
    get_last_element(lst)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
