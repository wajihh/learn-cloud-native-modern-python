## Problem Statement

Write a program which prompts the user for an adjective, then a noun, then a verb, and then prints a fun sentence with those words!

Mad Libs is a word game where players are prompted for one word at a time, and the words are eventually filled into the blanks of a word template to make an entertaining story! We've provided you with the beginning of a sentence (the SENTENCE_START constant) which will end in a user-inputted adjective, noun, and then verb.

Here's a sample run (user input is in bold italics):

Please type an adjective and press enter. tiny 

Please type a noun and press enter. plant 

Please type a verb and press enter. fly 

Code in Place is fun. I learned to program and used Python to make my tiny plant fly!


## Starter Code

```bash
def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Solution

```bash
SENTENCE_START: str = "Panaversity is fun. I learned to program and used Python to make my " # adjective noun verb

def main():
    # Get the three inputs from the user to make the adlib
    adjective: str = input("Please type an adjective and press enter. ")
    noun: str = input("Please type a noun and press enter. ")
    verb: str = input("Please type a verb and press enter. ")

    # Join the inputs together with the sentence starter
    print(SENTENCE_START + adjective + " " + noun + " " + verb + "!")


# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
