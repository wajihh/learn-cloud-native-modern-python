The instructors will check your project in the onsite class on the due date. If you do not submit on the due date, you will be removed from
the class until you successfully complete your project and submit it.

For practice you should do the following homework projects (not to be submitted only for practice in class and at home):

## We will be using Google Colab for development:

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook service developed by Google. It enables users to write and execute Python code through a web browser, offering seamless integration with Google Drive for easy storage and sharing of notebooks. Colab is particularly beneficial for tasks in machine learning, data analysis, and education, as it provides access to powerful computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, without requiring any local setup. 

**Key Features of Google Colab:**

- **No Setup Required:** Users can start coding immediately without the need to install any software or manage local environments. 

- **Free Access to Computing Resources:** Colab offers free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, facilitating the execution of complex computations and machine learning models. 

- **Collaboration:** Notebooks can be easily shared and collaboratively edited, similar to Google Docs, enhancing teamwork and knowledge sharing. 

- **Integration with Google Drive:** Notebooks are stored in Google Drive, allowing for straightforward organization and access across devices. 

- **Support for Various Libraries:** Colab supports popular Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy, making it versatile for various data science and machine learning projects. 

**Recent Developments:**

Recently, Google expanded Colab's AI-powered code assistance features to all users in eligible locales, including those on free plans. These features assist in generating code from natural language prompts and provide a code-assisting chatbot to enhance programming efficiency and comprehension. 

**Getting Started with Google Colab:**

To begin using Google Colab:

1. **Access Colab:** Navigate to the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Create a New Notebook:** Click on "File" > "New Notebook" to create a new Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Write and Execute Code:** Enter your Python code in the code cells and execute them to see the results.

4. **Save and Share:** Your notebooks are automatically saved in your Google Drive, and you can share them with others by clicking the "Share" button.

For more detailed information and tutorials, refer to the [Colaboratory Frequently Asked Questions](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) and the [Colab Help Center](https://support.google.com/colab/).

Google Colab is a valuable tool for both beginners and professionals in data science and machine learning, offering an accessible platform to develop and share projects efficiently.
